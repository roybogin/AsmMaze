# AsmMaze

Project made in 2017

This project is a game of a maze in which you are the blue square that needs to get to the green patch by using the arrow keys without touching the black walls or the black enemy.
The game contains a high score system that records the highest score achieved and lets you enter your name when you break it.

This project was made using MASM32.

The libraries adp_gui and heinemannlib were writted by [Ido Heinemann](https://www.github.com/idoheinemann).
